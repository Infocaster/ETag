An ETag is like a version number: it tells consumers if they're up-to-date. Why serve the same content again, if they already have it?

By applying ETags, you can improve performance by saving both bandwidth and CPU usage. With this package, creating ETags is made easy. Apply it to all your content at once, or apply it only to specific pages.
